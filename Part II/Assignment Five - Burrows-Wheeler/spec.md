# Burrows–Wheeler data compression algorithm.

  This revolutionary algorithm outcompresses gzip and PKZIP, is relatively easy to implement, and is not protected by any patents. It forms the basis of the Unix compression utility bzip2.

 Three parts:

 - Move-to-front encoding and decoding. 
 - Circular suffix array.
 - Burrows–Wheeler transform.
